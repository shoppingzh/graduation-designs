ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* AmoBleTool使用说明.doc
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt
* si\
* si\si.IAB
* si\si.IAD
* si\si.IMB
* si\si.IMD
* si\si.PFI
* si\si.PO
* si\si.PR
* si\si.PRI
* si\si.PS
* si\si.SearchResults
* si\si.WK3
* 说明.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => AmoBleTool\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => AmoBleTool\src\main\assets
* lint.xml => AmoBleTool\lint.xml
* res\ => AmoBleTool\src\main\res\
* src\ => AmoBleTool\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
